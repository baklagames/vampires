		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "FGA-01 Town Tilemap Districts and Tileset Integration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Provide subtasks for designing the Residential, Main, and Industrial TMX files, defining collision shapes in Tiled, and implementing the Phaser loader to verify the 7-layer hierarchy.",
			"reasoning": "Designing three distinct maps with strict layer and object requirements is time-consuming but technically straightforward once the template is established."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Placeholder Asset Pack and Configuration Wiring",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for generating 16x16 PNGs for tiles and sprites, updating the global asset configuration file, and extending the Phaser Preloader to map these assets to game keys.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves basic asset generation and standard configuration updates, presenting low technical risk but requiring careful alignment."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "World Grid System and Spatial Masks",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Define subtasks for the WorldGrid class development, the bitmask derivation logic from Tiled data, coordinate conversion helpers, and the debug overlay for mask visualization.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a custom grid system with bitmasking and coordinate math requires precision and integrates deeply with movement and environment systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Phaser HUD, Overlays, and Playable Gameplay Loop Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into the UI Scene implementation, status bar logic, visual targeting/danger overlays, input handler mapping, and the core gameplay state machine.",
			"reasoning": "Wiring multiple UI elements, overlays, and a complex multi-state gameplay loop requires coordinating several systems (Input, Grid, HUD, Entities)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "NPC Entity System and Human Behavior Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for the HumanNpc class, the variant configuration system, the NpcManager with object pooling, and the random-wander AI state logic.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a robust entity system with pooling and variant-based attributes is a standard but essential architectural task for game performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Police Response and Panic Propagation Loop",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for the PanicBubbleController logic, the PoliceNpc entity class, the Heat-based spawning system, and the pathfinding-integrated chase AI.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task, involving reactive AI, dynamic event propagation (panic), and coordinating pathfinding with LOS checks in a chase scenario."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Day/Night Cycle and Sun Damage System Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Specify subtasks for the central DayNightController, the NPC behavior scaling logic, the spatial sun damage system, and the HUD phase transition alerts.",
			"reasoning": "Temporal management and spatial damage checks require integrating the grid system with a global timer and updating entity attributes dynamically."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "FGA-08 Pixellab AI Graphics Generation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Task is already well-defined with subtasks; no further expansion needed.",
			"reasoning": "This task is primarily about using external AI tools to replace placeholders. It is well-documented and already contains a detailed subtask breakdown."

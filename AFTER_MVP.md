# After MVP

## Deferred Features

- PWA offline mode and caching strategy.
- Cloud save and cross-device sync.
- Account-backed progression and recovery.
- Live-ops balancing pipeline (remote config + A/B tests).
- Expanded content: new districts, interiors, and enemy types.
- Accessibility pass (color-blind safe palette, scalable UI).

## Technical Debt

- Replace placeholder assets with production art and tilemaps.
- Improve pathfinding/steering and add collision navigation.
- Optimize scene batching for low-end mobile devices.
- Audit memory usage and GC pressure during long sessions.

## QA / Ops

- Broaden device matrix testing (low-end Android, older iOS).
- Establish crash/telemetry dashboards.
- Add performance budget regression checks (FPS, memory).

# Vampire Stealth Game PRD

This repository contains the English PRD, tech rules, and design system rules for a mobile-first (PWA-friendly) vampire stealth game prototype.

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Build and preview:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- The game bootstraps from `src/main.ts` and loads config from `src/config/default.yaml`.
